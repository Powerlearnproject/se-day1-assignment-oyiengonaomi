#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- softwaew engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software applications using principles, methods and tools to create high quality software
- It is important in dveloping systems that solve real life problems or making life tasks easier hence advancing the technology industry


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- 1968 : the first time software engneering was introduced in a software engineering conference in Germany. Very few people new about this but this conference brought it to the masses. The conference brought together researchers, practicioners and military personel to address the growing complexities of software systems. This event laid the groundwork for software engineering as a distinct discipline and led to the establishment of best practices and methodologies that are still in use today.

- 1970 : The development and promotion of structured programming. Programers were often face with the "spaghetti code" which was difficult to understand because of the use of unstractured programming. Edsger Dijkstra was one of the pioneers who advocated for structured programming which emphasized on the use of control structures which encouraged use of functions and procedures making code more readable and maintainable.

- 2001 : The creation of the agile manifesto. Software developers met in Utah to discuss lightweight development methods resuling to the agile method maifesto. It outlined the following four key values; individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, responding to change over following a plan. This marked a significance shift in software development because it promoted iterative development, flexibility and collaboration with customers. Moreover, it led to a focus in delivering value to customers quickly and adapting to the customer's changing requirements during the development process.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- idea generation: coming up with the software to be developed
-  Software plannong: defining the software's scope, goals, timeline, budget and resources
- sotware analysis: gathering and documenting detailed user requirements for the software
- software design: creating of the software's architecture, the user interface design and the system's design
- software implementation: writing of the code that will construct the software
- software testing: testing for any bugs or errors in the software
- software deployment: distributing the software to the target users
- software maintenance: addressing issues, adding new features and and making updates after the deployment of the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- In waterfall methodology tasks are performed in a systematic order in that one task cannot begin if the other is not yet completed while in agile methodology, tasks are performed incremmentally but allowing for flexibility.
- Waterfall methodology is appropriate for when a system needs to be developed in a certain time frame and does not have any change in the initial user's requirements during the development process while agile is suitable for developing a software that can accomodate the frequent change of the user's requirements during the development process.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
-   create and implement the software applications based on the user's requirements.
-   work with team members to understand the user's requirements
-   identify and fix any bugs or errors in the software application
-   document the technical document and the user manual
-   participate in reviewing the code.

Quality Assuarance Engineer
-   develop and implement testing strategies and plans
-   document and track defects and communicate them to the developer
-   analyze testing remarks and quality metrics for insights
-   advocate for quality
-   work with managers and developers to address issues early

Project Manager
-   does the planning of the project by defining the scope, objectives and deliverables
-   coordinates team efforts
-   identifies risks and develop mitigation strategies
-   serve as the primary contact to stakeholders
-   ensure quality standards are met
-   manage project budget


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
(IDEs enhance productivity by providing tools for code editing, debugging, and project management, which streamline the development process and improve code quality while VCSs facilitate collaboration among developers by enabling simultaneous work on the same codebase, tracking changes, and supporting branching and merging, thereby ensuring code integrity and facilitating effective project management.

An example of an IDE is apache netbeans 
An example of a VCS is Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Maintaining quality assurance. This can be solved by establishing formal quality assurance processes, including regular code reviews and testing cycles.

Trying to keep up with new technologies. This can be solved by encouraging continuous education and training for team members to stay updated on industry trends.

Integrating various systems and applications. This can be overcome by conducting thorough research and testing to ensure compatibility and smooth integration.

Proper software project management. This can be delt with by utilizing project management tools to organize tasks and resources effectively.

Ensuring strong security infrastructure. This can be overcome by implementing security best practices and conduct regular security assessments throughout the development process.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing : Testing individual components or modules in software in isolation to verify that each part functons correctly. This is important because;
-  it identifies issues at an early stage making them easier and less costly to fix
-  helps other developers understand the intended functionality of each module or component

Integration testing : verifying the interactions between different components or systems. It is important because;
-   ensures correct communication between different modules and the data being transfered between them is done accurately
-   ensures overall system functions as a cohesive unit

System testing : evaluates the complete and integrated software application to verify that it meets the specified requirements. This is important because;
-  Validates the entire system's functionality, performance and security
-  confirms the system meets all the functional and non-functional requirements

Acceptance testing : determines whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. This is important because;
-  Ensures the software meets the needs and the expectations of the end users
-  provides the stakeholders with confidence that the product is ready for deployment


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions that guide AI models to generate desired output.
- It is important because it enhances model performance without requiring changes to the underlying architecture.
- Moreover, it helps AI model facilitate logical reasoning by breaking down problems into manageble steps hence improving accuracy.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
I gave the AI model the question "What do you think about a situation?"
It is important because with each prompt I was getting more clear and spesific, the output generated became what i desired. At first it generated information on the internet that has the same or similar questions asked and then it generated random situations that can occur.
